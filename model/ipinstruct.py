welcome = "Welcome to the experiment! \n \n Here you will be tested on your ability to predict where a ball will go and catch it with a paddle \n \n "
welcome += "Click the mouse to see what the field will look like - try moving the paddle around first"

basictrial = "A typical trial will begin with the screen you just saw. When you click the mouse button, a ball will appear and you will "
basictrial += "need to catch it with the paddle. \n \n Once you have caught it or missed it, you can click again to move onto the next trial. \n \n "
basictrial += "Click the mouse to try an example"

slanttrial = "Of course, not all trials will be so easy - the ball can be shot at any angle \n \n Click the mouse to try another example"

bouncetrial = "And in many cases, the ball will bounce off the walls \n \n Click the mouse to try an example with a bounce"

smalltrial = "Also, the paddle will not always be in the same place \n \n Click the mouse to try an example close to the right wall"

largetrial = "Now you can click to try an example close to the left wall"

occludetrial = "But of course it's not going to be that easy. In the real experiment, you'll have to predict where the ball will land without "

occludetrial += "Click the mouse to try a trial with the ball hidden"

greypaddle = "You may have noticed that your paddle starts grey and turns black - this is because you can't catch a ball while the screen isn't "
greypaddle += "hidden \n \n Your paddle will turn black and be able to catch balls as soon as the screen becomes hidden, so don't try catching "
greypaddle += "the ball before this \n \n Click the mouse and put your paddle in the middle of the screen to see what happens if you try"

preexamples = "Now that you've seen what we're asking you to do, let's warm up a bit \n \n You will now have six example trials to get "
preexamples += "comfortable before we start the experiment \n \n Click the mouse to start"

postinstruct = "We hope you're warmed up, because now it's time to start the experiment \n \n From now on, you'll be scored on your "
